## Conclusion

While each project shows strengths in specific areas, all four projects demonstrate significant room for improvement, particularly in code quality and security. Rig leads in AI framework implementation, while AIOS excels in execution performance. However, the consistently low scores in code quality and security across all projects highlight industry-wide challenges in maintaining high engineering standards in AI development.

Key recommendations for all projects:
1. Prioritize code quality improvements
2. Implement comprehensive security measures
3. Enhance documentation and testing
4. Focus on maintainability and scalability

This analysis underscores the importance of balanced development practices that consider not just AI capabilities, but also code quality, execution reliability, and security measures.
